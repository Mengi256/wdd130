        Uganda is a landlocked country in East Africa, known for its natural
        beauty, diverse wildlife, and rich culture. It is often called "The
        Pearl of Africa" due to its stunning landscapes, including lakes,
        mountains, and national parks. The capital city is Kampala. Uganda is
        home to many ethnic groups, and its official languages are English and
        Swahili. The economy mainly depends on agriculture, but tourism is also
        growing. Despite past challenges, Uganda continues to develop and grow
        steadily.
