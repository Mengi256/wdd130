      <p>
        Hey! My name is Mengi Mariam, and I'm originally from Uganda. I am a
        BYUâ€“Pathway student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Software Development
        at BYUâ€“Idaho. I'm passionate about technology and excited to grow in the
        world of web development. I look forward to creating my own website,
        building real-world projects, and learning more about the tech industry.
        I'm eager to gain new skills and see what the future holds for me in
        this exciting field! Technology has always fascinated me,how it solves problems, connects people, and transforms lives. I enjoy learning how things work behind the scenes, especially in websites and applications. Every new concept I explore, from HTML,CSS and beyond, gives me a greater sense of creativity and confidence. I find joy in turning ideas into working code, and I'm always looking for ways to improve and challenge myself. As I continue on this journey, I hope to collaborate with others, contribute to meaningful projects, and stay up to date with new trends in the tech industry. This path excites me every single day.

        Uganda is a landlocked country in East Africa, known for its natural
        beauty, diverse wildlife, and rich culture. It is often called "The
        Pearl of Africa" due to its stunning landscapes, including lakes,
        mountains, and national parks. The capital city is Kampala. Uganda is
        home to many ethnic groups, and its official languages are English and
        Swahili. The economy mainly depends on agriculture, but tourism is also
        growing. Despite past challenges, Uganda continues to develop and grow
        steadily.
